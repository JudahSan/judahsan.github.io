My work involves backend, frontend, and game development, along with disassembling and reassembling computer parts.

I like orchestral music, read thriller and tech books, and enjoy sim games. I'm also trying walking these days.

Currently, I'm refining Ruby on Rails, learning Golang, resuming my operating system development study group program, and prepping for AWS exams. I'm interested in Inertia Rails, Golang, and ERPNext projects, but remain flexible.
