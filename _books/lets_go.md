Let's Go teaches you step-by-step how to create fast, secure and maintainable web applications using the fantastic programming language Go (also known as Golang).

The idea behind the book is to help you learn by doing. Together we'll walk through the start-to-finish build of a complete web application, from starting a server for the first time to session management and authenticating users.

Building a complete web application has a number of benefits: it helps put the things you're learning into context, demonstrates how different parts of your codebase link together, and forces us to work through the edge-cases and difficulties that come up when writing software in real-life.
