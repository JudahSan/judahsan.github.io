Let’s Go is a clear, concise and easy-to-follow guide to web development with Go.

It packs in everything you need to know about best practices, project structure and practical code patterns — without skimping on important details and explanations.

Go is a great language for building web applications. But teaching yourself from blog posts and the standard library documentation can be a big time-sink and leave you with more questions than answers.

The book walks through the start-to-finish build of a complete working application, helping you to learn by doing. You’ll get practical experience implementing common real-life code patterns, the topics that you’re learning about are put in context, and you’ll end up with a well-structured codebase that you can adapt for your own future work.

By the end of the book, you’ll have all the knowledge and confidence that you need to build your own professional, production ready, web applications.
