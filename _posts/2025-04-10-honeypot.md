# Honeypots: A Lightweight Bot Defense Strategy

## Introduction

- A honeypot, in the context of web security, is a trap designed to attract and detect malicious automated software (bots). It's essentially a hidden field in a form that is invisible to human users but is often filled in by bots that blindly fill all form fields. If the honeypot field is populated, it's a strong indicator that the submission is from a bot, allowing you to reject it.

- Honeypots allow your application to ignore spambots without forcing your users to fill out a captcha or jump through other hoops to fillout your form

- This is done by adding a hidden field only visible to spambots. This field helps admin identify whether the user is a spambot and not a user


**Benefit:**

* **Lightweight and User-Friendly:** Unlike CAPTCHAs, honeypots don't add friction for legitimate users.
* **Effective Against Basic Bots:** They effectively block simple bots that blindly fill all form fields.
* **Simple Implementation:** Relatively easy to implement in web forms.

**Illustration:**

Imagine a form with fields like "Email," "Password," and a hidden field labeled "Nickname" (our honeypot). A human user won't see or interact with "Nickname." However, a bot, programmed to fill all fields, will fill it. If the "Nickname" field has data, it indicates a likely bot submission.

```html
<form>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email"><br><br>

  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" name="password"><br><br>

  <div style="display:none;">
    <label for="nickname">Leave this field blank:</label>
    <input type="text" id="nickname" name="nickname" autocomplete="off">
  </div>

  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
```

## ✅ 1. Add the Honeypot Field in Your Devise Registration Form

Edit:

```erb
# app/views/devise/registrations/new.html.erb
<div style="display:none;">
  <%= f.label :nickname, "Leave this field blank" %>
  <%= f.text_field :nickname, autocomplete: "off" %>
</div>
```

Here, `:nickname` is the honeypot field. `autocomplete: "off"` is added to help prevent browser's autofill features from accidentally filling the honeypot.

## ✅ 2. Permit the Honeypot Param in Your Controller

In `application_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  before_action :configure_permitted_parameters, if: :devise_controller?

  protected

  def configure_permitted_parameters
    devise_parameter_sanitizer.permit(:sign_up, keys: [:nickname])
  end
end
```

This ensures that the `nickname` parameter is allowed in the form submission.

## ✅ 3. Add Honeypot Validation to Your User Model

In `user.rb`:

```ruby
validate :nickname_should_be_blank

def nickname_should_be_blank
  errors.add(:base, "Bot detected") unless nickname.blank?
end
```

This validation checks if the `nickname` field is empty. If it's not, an error is added, and the registration fails.

## ✅ 4. Add the `nickname` Column to the Users Table

In your terminal:

```bash
rails generate migration AddNicknameToUsers nickname:string
rails db:migrate
```

If you don’t want to store it, you can use `attr_accessor` instead of a DB column:

```ruby
attr_accessor :nickname
```

In this case, no DB migration is needed. Perfect for pure honeypot use.

## ✅ 5. (Optional) Add Server-Side Logging for Bots

In your model:

```ruby
def nickname_should_be_blank
  if nickname.present?
    Rails.logger.warn "🚨 Bot detected during sign up: IP #{request.remote_ip}" rescue nil
    errors.add(:base, "Bot detected")
  end
end
```

Or trigger an event, email, or anything you want.

## ⚠️ Problems You May Face

* **Advanced Bots:** Sophisticated bots might be programmed to detect and avoid honeypots.
* **Accidental Human Interaction:** Although rare, a user with accessibility needs or a very unusual browser setup could accidentally fill the hidden field.
* **Browser Autofill:** some browser autofill features may accidently fill the hidden field. The autocomplete="off" attribute helps, but isn't a perfect solution.

## 🛠️ Alternative Solutions

* **CAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA:** Provides a more robust defense against bots but can be intrusive to users.
* **Rate Limiting:** Limits the number of registration attempts from a single IP address, preventing brute-force attacks.
* **Behavioral Analysis:** Analyzes user behavior to detect bot-like patterns.
* **Double Opt-In:** Requires users to confirm their email address, ensuring they are real.
* **Javascript challenges:** Require javascript to be run to submit the form, which blocks many simple bots.

## 🎯 Done!

Real users won’t see the field, bots will likely fill it in, and your app quietly blocks them. Remember to complement this with other security measures for comprehensive protection.
