### [Live Reloading](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41429055/13919366) <br><br>

Live Reload reloads or refreshes the entire go app when a file changes. For example, if you were four links deep into your navigation and saved a change, live reloading would restart the app and load the app back to the initial route.


### Benefits of Live Reload<br><br>

1. Increased Development Speed - Reduces downtime caused by repeatedly stopping and starting the server.
2. Faster Debugging - Enables quick testing of changes and immediate feedback.

#### How to Enable Live Reload in Go<br><br>

[Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air) is a powerful live-reloading CLI utility for developing Go applications. It detects changes on Go files and automatically reloads the server, ensuring that your changes are reflected in real-time. This enhances the developer experience by allowing them to focus on coding rather than manually restarting the application.

#### Installation and Setup Guide for Air<br><br>

1. **Install via**:

   Run the following command to install Air:
     ```bash
     go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
     ```

2. Open Your Project Directory and Initialize `.air.toml`:

  - **Navigate to your project path**: <br><br>

   ```bash
     cd /path/to/your_project
     ```

  - **Initialize the Air configuration file**: <br><br>

   ```bash
     air init
     ```

> üîó After running the above, open the `.air.toml` file and adjust the settings as needed.


### Troubleshooting

1. [Air Not Rebuilding the Project After Moving Files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78804418/go-air-isnt-building-my-project-after-i-moved-the-files-to-subdirectories)

   If you move the Go files to subdirectories, Air may stop detecting changes.

#### Fix üõ†Ô∏è

Modify the `cmd` parameter in the `.air.toml` file to specify the correct location of `main.go`.<br><br>

```
cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ./cmd/web/."
```

Update the `.include_dir` setting to ensure Air watches the correct directories:<br><br>

```
include_dir = ["cmd", "internal", "ui"]
```

> Note: Do not use a leading `./` in the directory names.

Example Project Structure:

```
cmd/
  web/
internal/
ui/
 html/
   pages/
   partials/
 static/
   css/
   img/
   js/
.air.toml
.gitignore
go.mod
go.sum
```

`air.toml` file:

```
root = "."
testdata_dir = "testdata"
tmp_dir = "tmp"


[build]
  args_bin = []
  bin = "./tmp/main"
  cmd = "go build -o ./tmp/main ./cmd/web/."
  delay = 1000
  exclude_dir = ["assets", "tmp", "vendor", "testdata"]
  exclude_file = []
  exclude_regex = ["_test.go"]
  exclude_unchanged = false
  follow_symlink = false
  full_bin = ""
  include_dir = ["cmd", "internal", "ui"]
  include_ext = ["go", "tpl", "tmpl", "html"]
  include_file = []
  kill_delay = "0s"
  log = "build-errors.log"
  poll = false
  poll_interval = 0
  post_cmd = []
  pre_cmd = []
  rerun = false
  rerun_delay = 500
  send_interrupt = false
  stop_on_error = false

[color]
  app = ""
  build = "yellow"
  main = "magenta"
  runner = "green"
  watcher = "cyan"

[log]
  main_only = false
  silent = false
  time = false

[misc]
  clean_on_exit = false

[proxy]
  app_port = 0
  enabled = false
  proxy_port = 0

[screen]
  clear_on_rebuild = false
  keep_scroll = true
```
